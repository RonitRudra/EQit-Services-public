## Guidelines for effective code management
1. **DO NOT** work on the master branch. This branch is only for functional code and assumes the project is deployable. 
2. Always create a branch when working on an issue. The name of the branch should be informative. For example, if you are working on an issue titled *Create Login Page*, name the branch as *create-login-page* (you get the idea).
3. After you have resolved the issue by submitting a pull request, **DO NOT** make new commits. The reviewers will check the request and on successful resolution, will merge the branch with the *Master* and delete the branch you were working on.
2. When working on an issue, commit frequently with detailed explanations and commit messages so it's easy to track.
3. Use suitable *Issue Labels* when raising an issue. Always add the milestone and project related to the issue if available.
4. Use issue keywords to resolve issues automatically when making commits or making a pull request.
5. Use *Wiki* to write technical and project progress reports. This would also contain an exhaustive manual on better managing workflow.
